# DeepSpeed MII Examples

Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Once [DeepSpeed-MII](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed-mii) is installed you have two options for deployment: an interactive non-persistent pipeline or a persistent serving deployment. See the scripts in [non-persistent](./non-persistent/) and [persistent](./persistent/) for examples. Details on the code implemented in these scripts can be found on our [Getting Started guide for MII](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeed-mii#getting-started-with-mii).
